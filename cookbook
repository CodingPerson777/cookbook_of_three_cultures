  <h4>Tiramisu</h4>
  <img src="https://www.rouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Tiramisu-585178794.jpg" width="500px">
  <p>Ingredients</p>
  <ul>
    <li>300 g (~10 oz) of Savoiardi (Ladyfingers)</li>
    <li>500 g (1.1 pound) of mascarpone cheese.</li>
    <li> 4 medium eggs</li>
    <li>100 g (½ cup) of granulated sugar
</li>
    <li>300 ml (1 ¼ cup) of espresso coffee</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of Marsala Wine</li>
    <li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <p>Recipe</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First of all, make the coffee. For a quick and delicious Italian coffee, we used an Espresso Machine. Then add 2 tablespoons of Rum or Marsala wine. This is optional. If you don't like liqueurs or you are making Tiramisu for children, don't use it. Your tiramisu is great all the same, even without liqueur. Set aside and let cool.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Set aside the yolks and whip the egg whites until stiff: you will get at it when the the egg whites will not move if you turn the bowl over. Remember that to whip egg whites to stiff peaks, there should be no trace of yolk. Once ready, set aside.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Now, in a bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>In the meantime, pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with a spoon to make it softer. Mascarpone cheese must be of excellent quality, creamy and thick. When the yolks are ready add the mascarpone cheese.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Using the flexible-edge k-beater, slowly whip the mascarpone cream for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the stiffly beaten egg whites.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Mix with a wooden spoon, from bottom up. Mix slowly until smooth and creamy.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Now let's prepare the layers of ladyfingers and mascarpone cream. You can make 2 or more layers, depending on the width and depth of your pan.
<br>
<br>      
Dip the ladyfingers quickly (1 or 2 seconds) into the coffee. Then arrange the ladyfingers in the casserole of your liking.
<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: The ladyfingers should not soak too much coffee, otherwise the tiramisu will be too rich in coffee and runny.
    </li>
    <li>Arrange them so that they cover the bottom of the casserole. Then spread the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add another layer of ladyfingers and then top with more mascarpone cream. If you are making the last layer, spread the mascarpone cream generously.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Finally, sprinkle with cocoa powder. You can even add dark chocolate chips, if you like. Allow to rest 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Even better if you prepare the tiramisu the day before, letting it rest overnight.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Ingredients</p>
  <ul>
    <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>3 pounds bone-in chicken thighs, drumsticks, or a combination</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola</li>
    <li>3 dried bay leaves</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce, preferably a Filipino brand like Silver Swan</li>
    <li>1/3 cup cane vinegar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
    <li>Steamed white rice, for serving</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <p>Recipe</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Smash and peel 5 garlic cloves. Pat 3 pounds chicken thighs, drumsticks, or a combination dry with paper towels. Season all over with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in 2 batches, add the chicken to the pot (skin-side down if using thighs). Sear until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch (reduce the heat as needed if starting to burn). Transfer to a plate.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Place the garlic, 3 dried bay leaves, and 2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns in the pot. Stir until the garlic cloves and peppercorns are slightly toasted and fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 2 cups water, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup cane vinegar, and 3 tablespoons oyster sauce. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Return the chicken and any accumulated juices on the plate to the pot, arranging the chicken in a single layer (skin-side down if using thighs). Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook uncovered until the chicken registers at least 165ºF in the thickest part, flipping each piece over halfway through, about 20 minutes total. When the chicken is almost ready, arrange a rack in the upper-third of the oven and heat the oven to broil. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Using tongs, transfer the chicken (skin-side up if using thighs) to the baking sheet. Continue to let the sauce simmer on the stove. Broil the chicken until browned on top, about 3 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven, flip each piece, and brush with some of the sauce from the pot. Return the chicken to the oven and broil until browned on the second side, about 3 minutes more. Remove and discard the bay leaves if desired. Serve with steamed white rice and drizzle heavily with the sauce.
    </li>

            <ol><p>Recipe</p>
            <li>First, make the tomato-based sauce by blending together the red bell peppers (pimento), tomatoes, onion, and scotch bonnet.</li>
            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat, then add the diced onions and let them cook for about 3 minutes or until they are soft.
            </li><li>Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then stir in garlic, ginger, and bay leaves—leave to cook for 2 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the blended sauce and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced and the sauce become thick —about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with thyme, curry powder, bouillon cubes, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rinsed rice to the sauce and stir until it is well coated with the sauce. Then add the chicken stock, stir briefly, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and bring to a quick boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat immediately to low and steam until the rice is done—about 30 minutes.</li></ol>
